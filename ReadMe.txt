Designed as one of my first computer science projects in secondary school.

Brief:
      Attached below are two CSV files. Dictionary contains the names of all the countries represented in the Summer Olympics from 1986 - 2012. Summer.csv contains the names of the winner, the sports they won in and the medals they won.

      Create a program that will do the following: (Each part is a step to building a bigger program)
      Create a program that can read in each file separately.
      Create a program that can isolate a single column and print out the entries
      Create a program to find out which country has won the most amount of medals.
      Create a program to illustrate the number of medals won by each country. 
      Remember to use Pandas in each case and for the last part you will need to import the matplotlib as well
      
It seperates each country's medals into a dictionary, ranks each country based on its amount of medals in total.
The top ranking countries are displayed on a bar chart which is broken into Gold, Silver and Bronze.

This is one of my earlier projects and is quite simple, but it shows my ability to work with very large datasets (over 30,000 rows) and display them in an easy to read way.
